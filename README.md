# Work Day Scheduler

This is a simple calendar application that allows users to save events for each hour of the day. The application is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and it utilizes the Bootstrap framework for styling and the jQuery library for dynamic updates.

## User Story

As an employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar when the planner is opened.
- When scrolling down, timeblocks for standard business hours are presented.
- Each timeblock is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
- Clicking into a timeblock allows the user to enter an event.
- Clicking the save button for a timeblock saves the entered text for that event in local storage.
- When the page is refreshed, the saved events persist.
